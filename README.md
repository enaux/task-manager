<h1>Task Manager</h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>

This is a Task Manager Program.<br>
It can manage multiple tasks for multiple members of a team.<br>

<br>
The key functions offered within the program are:
<ul>
  <li>registering new users</li>
  <li>adding new tasks (and assigning these to team members)</li>
  <li>viewing all tasks</li>
  <li>viewing the user's tasks</li>
  <li>generating reports (i.e. detailed information regarding current task management status)</li>
  <li>displaying statistics (e.g. current number of users, current number of tasks).</li>
</ul>

<br>
The user must login before using the program.

<br>
The following username and passord give admin rights if entered:<br> 
username = admin<br>
password = password<br>

<br>
All tasks managed by the program are stored in "tasks.txt", which the program will create
if the file does not already exist.<br>
All registered users are listed in "users.txt", which the program will create if the file
does not already exist.

<h2>Installation</h2>

<h2>Usage Instructions</h2>

<h2>Credits</h2>
This program was inspired by a capstone project I developed as part of HyperionDev's Skills Bootcamp in Software Engineering (Fundamentals).
